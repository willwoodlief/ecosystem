#Ecosystems




An organic programming language and environment to grow critters and stuff in the browser.

Not much here right now. Just some unorganized notes.

An ecosystem programming system is where many different items interact with each other, and only some of the interactions are useful to people. The rest of the code is the items themselves which have their own purpose and being, which have little to do with anyone's needs for scripts or calculations.

The trade off here is that there is a pool of code which can evolve to grow solutions that people can find useful.

The other trade off is this creates some really fascinating and cool stuff.

This is a long standing project of mine, and I created a new repo to try a fresh approach
to see how such a world can be built up from a few simple rules.
