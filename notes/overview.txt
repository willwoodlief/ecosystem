Code becomes shaped and either co-code or regular code
Container is shaped code with subranges attached to the levels
A space coordinate is a container that has another level coordinate system
attached to at least one subrange

subranges contain flavors

A world is space attached to each other directly

space can be attached either directly or through a gate
a gate is indistinguishable from a direct connection from the sides
of a space connected

a potential pool is the potential that must be there. Any code that exists
is = to a certain amount of potential
free potential is the potential that must be there but not bonded to any code
or is not code already

so inside a potential pool , code is automatically made and/or given potential
until the free potential is = code + bonded potential

during a code exchange between co-code and code, bonded potential either
passes between the code or some bonded potential becomes free potential again
the free potential automatically becomes code once enough has accumulated.

Code can be converted to potential again, but only a certain amount of the
potential becomes bonded potential to the code converting it

A potential pool always has the same sum of free + bonded + code
