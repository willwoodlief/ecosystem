shaped x co-code = co-code (original), shaped,co-code(new)


So new law:
the sum of the potential is conserved in a code reaction

also potential can convert to code, and back again

so, to create more code from a reaction takes away from the potential
CC(a) + C(b) --> CC(a-n) + c(b-m) + New(o)

where o = m + n

------------------
code with no potential can be removed to form potential that is given to
the CC that deactivates it

Also, cc(a) + cc(b) --> cc(a+n) + cc(b-n)
if one cc can bind with another


so what determines if a code reaction just passes potential (and to which)
or forms new code with the potential ?

a) potential has to come off one thing
b) it has to be either applied to another or cannot be applied
c) potential that cannot be applied will form code (potential cannot exist without code)
d) will the new code have some potential, or will the potential be all used up in creating


Units of potential vs units of code
