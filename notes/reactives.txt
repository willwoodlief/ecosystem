shaped x co-code = co-code (original), shaped,co-code(new)


So new law:
the sum of the potential is conserved in a code reaction

also potential can convert to code, and back again

so, to create more code from a reaction takes away from the potential
CC(a) + C(b) --> CC(a-n) + c(b-m) + New(o)

where o = m + n

------------------
code with no potential can be removed to form potential that is given to
the CC that deactivates it

Also, cc(a) + cc(b) --> cc(a+n) + cc(b-n)
if one cc can bind with another


so what determines if a code reaction just passes potential (and to which)
or forms new code with the potential ?

a) potential has to come off one thing
b) it has to be either applied to another or cannot be applied
c) potential that cannot be applied will form code (potential cannot exist without code)
d) will the new code have some potential, or will the potential be all used up in creating


Units of potential vs units of code

when two interact there are two numbers compared:
result is
a) potential given
a2) code created
b) potential recieved
b2) code created
so number compared, three different ranges of difference, both positive and negative
1) all potential passed to existing
2) mix of passed to existing and creating new
3) all creating new

most new code is very small as the potential is not that much, unless
the range 2 and 3 is only for huge differences in potential between a and b
but how rare does this make the creation of new code , which needs to be frequent
