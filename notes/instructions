all items start as an array of code
some instructions in the array can give structure to the array


Type


  Level : Levels have code or memory, negative levels are system, 0 is init, and positive is code that can be run
          Level has potential stored
          Code needs potential to run, multiple levels can run at the same time


  Bands: Bands have color and can add other axis of level. A band starts on one level
         and ends on another level.
         Bands can contain other shaped code
    Color : how 2 items interact with each other, in a band
    Band level axis: basic level is only one access, but in a band 2 and 3 axis form so that colors of bands can form maps




  Read  Level | [Level]
      Reads in the level
  Write Level | [Level]
      Writes the level
  onChange Level | [Level]
      Pauses until the Level value has been written to again since last call
  doIfFalse Level | [Level]
      Pauses until the level value is zero
  doIfTrue Level | [Level]
      Pauses until the level value is not zero
  Math operations
  ()+-*/ other standard math stuff (floor,exp trig, etc)
  bit operations
  &|^
  logic, always makes a 0 or 1 value
  < > == etc
