Potential enables all code to fire
so at the minimum potential allows the code
that moves an object to fire

It takes potential to move between different subgroups
space is a collection of subgroups so it takes potential
to move through space

Also, the greater the differance of flavors between subgroups
the more potential it takes. Small differences in flavors
do not directly effect the potential needed, but the largest
differences require an enormous potential

Barriers or membranes are flavor differences between subgroups
Enough potential can overcome these.

When there is a flavor transfer, the potential is taken from the
shaped code in the container moving based on the most easiest
shed bonded potential.
So need to look at how potential is transfered again for more details.

Eventually, the more less easily shed potential needs work to release its
potential so reach a method of diminishing returns.

work is the ability to transfer bonded potential
and some code more tightly holds onto its potential than others
